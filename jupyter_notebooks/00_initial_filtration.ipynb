    "The basis for this entire project relies on the accuracy of establishing a dataset that includes only 'Traditional High Schools.' The definition we have chosen to use centers around schools that contain 11th or 12th grades, non-special education, non-juvenile justice, non-alternative schools; however, other filters include removing virtual schools, adult schools, schools without a matching National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) identifier (some excepetions).  Note that the dataset used herein inlcudes both the 2015-2016 CRDC school information, but also information gathered in the 2015-2016 NCES National Survey.  Below is the official filtration procedure:\n",
    "    - Join the uncompiled 2015-2016 NCES dataset into one dataset\n",
    "    - Join the compiled NCES dataset with the 2015-2016 CRDC dataset\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Filter Out (Dataset Attribute in Parentheses)\n",
    "        - Special Education, Alternative, Juvenile Justice Schools (CRDC)\n",
    "        - Schools without 11th or 12 Grade (CRDC)\n",
    "        - Virtual Schools (NCES)\n",
    "        - Schools reported as 'Elementary', 'Middle', or 'Other' (NCES)\n",
    "        - Special Education and Alternative/Other (NCES)\n",
    "        - Schools with 'Adult' in the name\n",
    "    - Recover Some Schools that did not have matching NCES identifiers\n",
    "        - Join recovered schools with dataset\n",
    "        - Remove any remaining schools that did not match\n",
