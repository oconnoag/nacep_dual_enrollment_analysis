<h1>2015-2016 Report on Dual Enrollment in Traditional Secondary Schools </h1>

The National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships (NACEP)

Alijah O'Connor, Adam Lowe

Every two years, the US Department of Education (ED) conducts a national survey for collecting information from all 
public schools (elementary and secondary) in the United States. This survey, known as the Civil Rights Data Collection 
(CRDC), provides key statistics on the state of education and civil rights issues in America. For more information about the
survey, see <a href='https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/data.html' target='_blank'>here</a>.

The National Alliance fo Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships focuses on ensuring that secondary schools can provide 
college level preparation to students taking college-credit-granting courses, known as dual enrollment courses (DE) (not to 
confused with Advanced Placement courses (AP)). The organization's efforts lead to benefits for both the students, who 
are better able to transition from secondary school to college, and the teachers, who gain further professionalism and 
teaching insights. For more information about NACEP, see <a href='http://www.nacep.org/' target='_blank'>here</a>.

This analysis uses data from the 2015-2016 CRDC as well as data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) (which includes more information about the schools in the CRDC dataset) to evalaute the status of DE
in America using the following metrics: number of schools that offer at least one DE course, number of
students enrolled in DE courses, and the dual enrollment participation rates of students in schools that
do offer DE courses. These metrics are further broken down by state, race, and by other factors relevant to the assessment. Note, the analyses were conducted only on traditional public high schools in America; schools were filtered out using the following criteria (with the corresponding dataset for the attribute in parentheses):

             - Special Education, Alternative, Juvenile Justice Schools (CRDC)
             - Schools without 11th or 12 Grade (CRDC)
             - Virtual Schools (NCES)
             - Schools reported as 'Elementary', 'Middle', or 'Other' (NCES)
             - Special Education, Alternative/Other, and \"Adult\" Schools (NCES)

All analyses were performed by Alijah O'Connor using Python (version 3.6, modules include matplotlib, pandas, and numpy, as well as project-specific modules) and Jupyter Notebooks.  Download the project virtual environment using the requirements.txt file in the repo.
